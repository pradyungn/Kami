#Kami
Changing the way we read.

There's too much information nowadays. To learn even a simple concept, we spend hours wading through meaningless filler. THat's why we came up with Kami -  a service meant to cut down the amount of text that people have to read.

##About
We programmed our backend with python, using Flask, NLTK, pytesseract, and PIL. This is hosted on an AWS EC2 server with an open API at api.kamiapp.ml (forces HTTPS btw). We also have crossplatform front ends. We have a web app at kamiapp.ml coded in Angular JS and iOS/Android applications coded in flutter. Our mobile apps can be found in the releases section of this github repo.
