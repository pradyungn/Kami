# Kami

Changing the way we read.

There's too much information nowadays. To learn even a simple concept, we spend hours wading through meaningless filler. That's why we came up with Kami -  a service meant to cut down the amount of text that people have to read. We achieve this by using a Machine Learning algorithm that will detect the most important parts of your text. It will show you both the original text and the cut down text.

## About

We programmed our backend with Python 3, using Flask, NLTK, Pytesseract, and PIL. This is hosted on an AWS EC2 server with an open API at https://api.kamiapp.ml (forces HTTPS btw). We also have a website and mobile apps. We have a web app at https://kamiapp.ml coded in Angular JS and iOS/Android applications coded in Flutter. Our mobile apps can be found at https://github.com/pradyungn/kami/releases. We handled authentication using Google Firebase.
